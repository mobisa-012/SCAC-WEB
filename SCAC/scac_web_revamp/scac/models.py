# so far umerun?
# eeeh, na imeonyesh logo, the background color and the links, though vertically
# nimekosea wapi kwa hiyo css file?
# wacha nione hio file kwa browser
# wait babe do i need to run it again over here?
# Create your models here.
# okay.
# but I thought it should run before I create the models?
# let me first setup python here give me a minute
# okay
